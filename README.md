# Stock Exchange Assistant

## Description
This project was the second miniproject as part of the React Web Development project in Fall 2019. It utilizes the Yahoo Finance API to create a Stock Exchange Assistant with the following features: 
* Watchlist of favorite stocks (locally saved)
* Table displaying the top gainer/losers/highest volume traded
* Desktop notifications when a stock is hits a certain price
* Recent News tab with a search bar to search for stock-specific news
* A game testing investment knowledge: you start with $1000 and are given a random month and year to put all you have into one stock, which stock would you pick to maximize rewards.

The application is hosted <a href="https://emilyzwang.github.io/StockAssistant/">here</a>, but has been disconnected from the API.
